## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Predecting demand for shared bikes.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
- Dataset used : BoomBikes Bike Sharing Dataset

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis : We have 82.59% acurecy to predict bike count on unknown data and 86.30% acurecy on known data.

## Technologies Used
- matplotlib - 3.6.3
- seaborn - 0.12.2
- pandas - 1.5.3
- numpy - 1.23.5
- sklearn - 1.2.2
- statsmodel - 0.13.5
